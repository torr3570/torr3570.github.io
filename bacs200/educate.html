    I found this video really interesting because I, myself struggle with insomnia and I find that my emotions vary with the amount of sleep I get a night. During this TEDTalk it is explained why your emotional response is linked with sleep, as well as why.

    <h3>Tracy Edwards - Stop Being a Bystander in Your Own Life</h3>

    <p>
    This video tells Tracy story of how she is an ocean racing sailor. The main reason I chose this video is because she explains how life is messy, and there is not one way of reaching success, or being completely happy and content with your life. She helps motivate people to stop looking at your life and what's going on, but to take control and make life the one you want to live. Not the life others want to live.

    This video is about a millenial computer scientist that does not have any form of social media. He goes on to explain the misconception of what people think when he states how he doesn't use social media. Newport, also goes in and explains the reason we use social media, and how we don't have to give into the societal norm. There is other ways of making information available, other ways of being successful other than using social media. He also wants to encourage the rest of us to quit social media; it is not a necessity.

   Carol Dweck goes on to explain a study that was performed to a group of 7th graders. This study goes on to explain the different forms of thinking, whether their mindset is fixed or if it can be developed. She then goes on to explain the continued information gathered through the study, and how they can help each student reach their full potential despite the different mindsets.
