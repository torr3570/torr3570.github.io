    <h1>Amusingly Me</h1>
    <p>by Naomi Torres</p>

    <p>This page is about all the things that amuse me. Some may be very nerdy yet interesting and the rest should be more surprising.</p>
   
    <h2>My favorite NFL Team</h2>

    <p>This site will take you to my favorite NFL Teams website. Anything and everything you need to know about the team is found here. Although based on the picture you might see already know what I am referring to. Everyone is alwasys surprised at who my favorite team is, especially because I was born and raised here in Colorado. However, my grandparents live in Texas, so I grew up watching this team.</p>

    <p>One weird and fun thing that amuses me are sharks. I love how there is still so much to learn about sharks and the ocean as a whole. This upcoming next website will show you my favorite week, Shark Week.</p>

    <p>This site is where I get all my hoodies, and most importantly shoes. This site amuses me because every time I get on I always stubble across a new pair of shoes I apparently cannot live without. You would think there would be a limit to my spending, but you would be wrong. I guess you could say I have a problem.</p>
